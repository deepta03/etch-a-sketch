# etch-a-sketch

This project aims to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an [Etch A Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch), capitalizing on DOM manipulation, where the user can try creating linographic images. It initially starts off with a 75x75 grid of squares of equal size which is accomplished using CSS Flexbox that wraps into the next line to fit the container width. A “hover” effect is set up so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid like a pen would. The background is chosen in grey and the color changes to blue (in other words, the pen is blue). The **Reset Grid** button just under the heading will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered (between 1-100), the existing grid is removed, and a new grid is generated in the same total space as before (in this case 960px wide) so that the user gets a new sketch pad. Additional features such as the color of the grids being randomized and a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10% (to achieve completely colored square in ten interactions) have been commented out, just to keep it clean to play with. Enjoy sketching!
